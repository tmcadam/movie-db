# MovieDB

This is a really simple Python script that reads the contents of a folder containing movies, searches IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes for info on that movie, then creates a nice webpage (an html database really) using Datatables, to make your movie collection super easy to search. 

The page can be set to run locally on your machine or you can sync it to Dropbox, Github or Bitbucket to share unit with friends, using their basic web-hosting services. 

Enjoy!!
